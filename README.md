# Expensify App

An application, built by following the React & Redux course, found on Udemy. [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview). 

The course covers React fundamentals. This course appealed to me, as it provideds hands-on tutorials for complicatated subject matter. When I began this course; I was interested in learning about Redux and how to integrate it into my existing React applications.

This application has a full test suite as well as build and deploy pipeline.
